Activities:
Submit your solutions in a single text file.
Activity 1:
What will the following code print out?
x = 43
x = x + 1
print (x)
a) 43
b) 44
c) x + 1
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically
Submit your answer.

The answer is B - 44



Activity 2:
Write a sequence of statements into the Python interpreter to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour,
printing each one, and then to compute gross pay as (hours * rate). Your output lines should look something
like:
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25
Donâ€™t worry about making sure that Pay has exactly two digits after the decimal point.
Submit your code and the output by doing a copy/paste from the Python interpreter.

#convert types
rate = float(rate)
hrs = float(hrs)

ttlPay = rate * hrs

print("Pay:", ttlPay)

Activity 3:
Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and its type.
1. width / 2
2. width / 2.0
3. height / 3
4. 1 + 2 * 5
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers. Submit your answers.
Please put your answers into one text file for submission.
