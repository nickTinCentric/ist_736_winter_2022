    "Consider the following two dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    stock = {\"banana\": 6, \"apple\": 0, \"orange\": 32, \"pear\": 15}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    prices = {\"banana\": 4, \"apple\": 2, \"orange\": 1.5, \"pear\": 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Show the expression that gets the value of the stock dictionary at the key ‘orange’. Show a\n",
    "    statement that adds an item to the stock dictionary called ‘cherry’ with some integer value and\n",
    "    that adds ‘cherry’ to the prices dictionary with a numeric value. (Or pick your own fruit name.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Write the code for a loop that iterates over the stock dictionary and prints each key and value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Suppose that we have a list:\n",
    "    groceries = [‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘pear’]\n",
    "    Write the code that will sum the total number in stock of the items in the groceries list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Write the code that can print out the total value in stock of all the items. This program can\n",
    "    iterate over the stock dictionary and for each item multiply the number in stock times the price\n",
    "    of that item in the prices dictionary. (This can include the items for ‘cherry’ or not, as you\n",
    "    choose.)\n",
