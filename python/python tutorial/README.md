## Tutorial files is my work while going through the "Python for Everybody" course via EdX.org

### chapter 3 - conditional code
### chapter 4 - functions
### chapter 5 - loops

My code was built and debugged locally, some code will need to be tweaked and tuned to complete the requirements on the EdX lab.
